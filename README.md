This is a platform for the procedural generation of characters from personality traits.

It currently consists of several, inter-dependent, projects.

# Projects

* CharacterGeneration: Consists of a set of scripts to procedurally generate virtual characters. It also allows for the generation of pictures of them. It uses the [ManuelBastioniLAB](http://www.manuelbastioni.com/) add-on.
* VotingPlatform: Is a web-based platform (using [DJango](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) conceived to run psychological experiments where users vote on the pictures of virtual characters.
* MBLab-FalseTimePatch: It is a patch for the ManuelBastioniLAB allowing for the generation of characters via scripting. It is used by the CharacterGeneration project.
